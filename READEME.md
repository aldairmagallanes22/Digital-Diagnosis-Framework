### Problem

The micro, small and medium companies (mipymes) represent 95.5% of the total of companies in Mexico (INEGI, 2024). Right now, over 70% of these businesses have already begun a digitization process. However, the businesses that began this process and the group that didn’t share a common obstacle: the lack of knowledge in IT tools. And this phenomenon is not unique in Mexico, it is also observed some Latin American countries: in Colombia, 35% of companies face this problem, combined with a cultural resistance in 45%; in Chile, 65% of the businesses acknowledge that their employees lack the necessary digital skills and knowledge. (NIC México, 2025)

In other words, Latin American mipymes, especially in Mexico, have issues to begin a digitization process because their collaborators don’t know how to apply technology to upgrade their processes and results. Furthermore, we must consider that companies oversee giving good training to their employees and may not be doing it well in this step of the process.

## Solution

This project arises by the hesitation and obstacles hindering digitalization in Mexican MSMEs. This can be adapted to any environment or sector depending on the business, and costs and regulations based on its location.

The project is a calculator that diagnoses if your SME/entrepreneurship needs to digitalize calculating the ROI of three main triggers.
But more than a calculator, it tries to be the foundation of a consulting process that works to support the decision-making process of these businesses that are trying to digitalize an area of their business/project from knowing if its worth to pay for a ChatGPT membership to analyze reports and data, to know if its worth and possible to pay for a POS software and change their entire business model. 


Currently, the project only considers data and conditions specific to companies in the Retail sector.

Key triggers:

* Efficiency trigger: Calculates the cost of performing tasks manually versus the cost of acquiring software (in this case, a POS system).
* Risk trigger: Calculates the cost of the software versus the penalty for making an error when generating CFDIs (Digital Tax Receipts via Internet), taking the probability of error into account.
* Opportunity trigger: Calculates the profit the business earns without implementing card payments versus the potential profit it can gain by digitizing and implementing this payment method. This calculation includes the respective card payment commissions and the increase in sales resulting from the implementation of said method.
